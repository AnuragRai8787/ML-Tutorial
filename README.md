ML Tutorial
This repository contains a series of machine learning tutorials, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. Each tutorial is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook.

Tutorials
Tutorial 1: Basic Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction
File: ML T-1.ipynb

Description: This notebook covers the fundamentals of a machine learning project using a simple linear regression model.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: The "USA Housing" dataset is loaded using Pandas.

Data Preprocessing:

Missing values are artificially introduced to simulate a real-world scenario.

These missing values are then handled using mean imputation.

Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict housing prices.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using the RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualization: A scatter plot is generated to compare the actual prices vs. the predicted prices.

More tutorials will be added soon!
