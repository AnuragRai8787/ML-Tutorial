# ML-Tutorial

This repository contains a series of machine learning tutorials, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. Each tutorial is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook.

## Tutorials
### Tutorial 1: Basic Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction
**File:** ML T-1.ipynb

**Description:** This notebook covers the fundamentals of a machine learning project using a simple linear regression model.

**Key Steps:**

1. Data Loading: The "USA Housing" dataset is loaded using Pandas.

2. Data Preprocessing:

   - Missing values are artificially introduced to simulate a real-world scenario.

   - These missing values are then handled using mean imputation.

3. Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict housing prices.

4. Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using the RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. Visualization: A scatter plot is generated to compare the actual prices vs. the predicted prices.
